# Update #1 on Apr 23rd, 2023.

I have been learning the book *Finite Field* written by the great mathematician **Rudolf Lidl** for a whole semester. 

This book is quite good and can be easily understood by students majored in CS who are going to do some research in Codes. Here is my learning notes on this book written in Chinese. 

Here is the brief introduction of this book:

**Chapter 1-3** have been uploaded. 

**Chapter 1** is about the definition of Groups, Rings, Fields, Polynomials and Field extension. 

**Chapter 2** is about the structure of Finite Field including traces, norms and bases, roots of unity and cyclotomic Polynomials. It also talks about how to represent the elements of Finite Fields.

**Chapter 3** is about the polynomials over Finite Fields especially the irreducible polynomials and linearized polynomials.

**Chapter 4** is about some algorithms to factorize the polynomials. The notes in Chinese will be uploaded after a quite long time. If you are interested about such algorithms, you can refer to the file *FULLTEXT01* provided by the **School of Computer Science, Physics and Mathematics of Linnaeus University**, which is now a public material.

**Chapter 5** is about the Exponential Sums. It seems that there's quite little material about this. I haven't finished this part of learning. Here is an incomplete version. The completed version will be uploaded within a month.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me by 51255902065@stu.ecnu.edu.cn. If you want to share it on other public platforms like Zhihu, please share this Repository at the same time.

# Update #2 on May 5th, 2023.
The complete version of ** Chapter 5** has been uploaded. For the knowledge of Continued Fraction is not that useful in my research field, such notes do not exists, which means notes after Theorem 5.52 do not exists.
